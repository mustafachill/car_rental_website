This is my online web application for the database structures class. In order to run the application it needs a database with data already in it.

- use MAMP on port 80

- use MySQL Workbench to create and fill the database

The database SQL code is provided in this project in the file SQL_code.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Start the MAMP server application

2. Start MySQL Workbench

3. Create a new schema and open a SQL script editor

4. Paste the contents of "SQL_code.txt" into the script editor

5. Run/compile the ENTIRE script   <--- THIS IS IMPORTANT

6. Check for any errors. If non occurred then the console at the bottom should be lit up with green

7. Close MySQL Workbench

8. place the 'car_rental folder that you downloaded **(the one this file is in)** in 'C:\MAMP\htdocs\' so that the directory looks like 'C:\MAMP\htdocs\car_rental'

9. Go to any browser and enter 'http://localhost/car_rental/login.php'

10. You should have successfully opened the web app
